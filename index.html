  <li>Next, select any directory where you will make your project.</li>
  <li>In that directory, make 5 sub-directories:- "java","class","jar","dex","res".</li>
  <li>Concept is that you will make java programs as source code and keep in 'java' directory. </li>
  <li>Using 'javac' command you will compile into ".class" files and keep in "class" directory. </li>
  <li>While compiling you may need external libraries in '.jar' files. So keep them in 'jar' directory. </li>
  <li>Then you will use 'dx' command to combine all class files into .dex file and keep in 'dex' directory. </li>
  <li>Lastly you will make an '.apk' file from '.dex' file & '.jar' external libraries. </li>
  <li>Using 'adb' command, you transfer the apk file app to ur mobile using usb data cable </li>
