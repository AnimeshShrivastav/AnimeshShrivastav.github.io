  Making Java Files to collectively establish a java program or project.
</p></h1>
<hr/>

<li>A java source code is a collection of .java files.</li>
<li>Each java file is a program in form of class.</li>
<li>But a class cant do anything itself. It is just outline or schema of object.</li>
<li>So, class is a small program which has variables & functions in it.</li>
<li>So, class is a data-type along with a function-type.</li>
<li>Like many variables of a particular data type can be declared,defined and used. Similarly, many objects of class-type can be created </li>
<li>Now package statement in the top of programs tell which package the class-program belongs and which sub-directory it resides </li>
<li>Similar packages will certainly reside in similar sub-directories and programs of same package can access each other's classes </li>
<li>Dis-similar packages can import each-other's classes by import statement because they reside in different directories. </li>
<li>classpath variable determines where the import statement will search for classes & packages. JRE/LIB/EXT is default for external library-search </li>
<li>public static void main() function is entry point for running code in java programs-project</li>
<li>Inside this function various objects of classes can be instantiated and their threads may be run in parallel.</li>
<li>In android-app apk, this entry point is in one or many 'Activities' which are a particular type of classes.</li>
<li>These activities cannot be instantiated as they play the role of 'public static void main()'</li>
<li>Inside the manifest, these activities are defined and told when to start them.</li>
<li>When they start, they start as separate process uniquely identified by its context variable.</li>
<li>They have all resources of mobile available to them like screen,mic,camera,gps,etc. as they asked in there manifest</li>
<li>When these activities run, they can start threads of other classes instantiated objects.</li>
<li>Thus a chain of programs will run as per user's itentions.</li>

<u>A Sample Plain Java Program</u><br/>
//Name of Program=Hello.java<br/>
package com.pkg<br/><br/>
import java.io.*;<br/><br/>

public class Hello<br/>
{<p style="margin-left:5%">
  public static void main(String[] args) /* String[] args are associated runtime parameters*/ <br/>
  {<p style="text-indent:10%">
      System.out.println("Hello"); /* we dont instantiate Hello class because it has main() function which will be auto-called by PC o/s when run */
   <p style="margin-left:5%">
  }
</p>
}<br/>

<u>A Sample Android Java Program</u><br/>
//Name of Program=Hello.java<br/>
package com.pkg<br/><br/>
import java.io.*;<br/>
import android.os.*;<br/>
import android.app.*;<br/><br/>

public class Hello extends Activity /* this Hello class is extension of inbuilt 'Activity' class in android.jar library of classes */<br/>
{<p style="margin-left:5%">
  public void onCreate(Bundle b)/*because its instantiated by mobiles's operating system we put code inside this function.Bundle is like String[] args */ <br/> 
  {<p style="margin-left:10%">
      TextView info=new TextView(this); /* make a 'TextView' variable rather object called info. 'this' means this class's object will have the TextView assigned */<br/>
      info.setText("Hello"); /* set the text displayed inside ="Hello". TextView is kind of text-box */<br/>
      setContentView(info);  /* set the overall viewable content i.e. mobile screen to point to this TextView */<br/>
   <p style="margin-left:5%">
  }
</p>
}
