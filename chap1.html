  Making Java Files to collectively establish a java program or project.
</p></h1>
<hr/>

<li>A java source code is a collection of .java files.</li>
<li>Each java file is a program in form of class.</li>
<li>But a class cant do anything itself. It is just outline or schema of object.</li>
<li>So, class is a small program which has variables & functions in it.</li>
<li>So, class is a data-type along with a function-type.</li>
<li>Like many variables of a particular data type can be declared,defined and used. Similarly, many objects of class-type can be created </li>
<li>Now package statement in the top of programs tell which package the class-program belongs and which sub-directory it resides </li>
<li>Similar packages will certainly reside in similar sub-directories and programs of same package can access each other's classes </li>
<li>Dis-similar packages can import each-other's classes by import statement because they reside in different directories. </li>
<li>classpath variable determines where the import statement will search for classes & packages. JRE/LIB/EXT is default for external library-search </li>
<li>public static void main() function is entry point for running code in java programs-project</li>
<li>Inside this function various objects of classes can be instantiated and their threads may be run in parallel.</li>
<li>In android-app apk, this entry point is in one or many 'Activities' which are a particular type of classes.</li>
<li>These activities cannot be instantiated as they play the role of 'public static void main()'</li>
<li>Inside the manifest, these activities are defined and told when to start them.</li>
<li>When they start, they start as separate process uniquely identified by its context variable.</li>
<li>They have all resources of mobile available to them like screen,mic,camera,gps,etc. as they asked in there manifest</li>
<li>When these activities run, they can start threads of other classes instantiated objects.</li>
<li>Thus a chain of programs will run as per user's itentions.</li>
